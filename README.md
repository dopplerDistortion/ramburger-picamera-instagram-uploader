Simply a photo Instagram photo uploader for Raspberry Pi + Pi Camera

You have to change USERNAME, PASSWORD with your Instagram account's insformation and PHOTODES to declare destination of taken photo. When you press "W" key from your keyboard it will take photo then upload it to your account without caption. To add just write the text you want between "" at insta.configure_photo(media_id, "") line 181.
